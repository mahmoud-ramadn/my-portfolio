## 🏗 Architecture

The marketplace clone follows a component-based architecture with:

1. **Presentation Layer**: React components with TypeScript
2. **State Management**: Local React state with hooks
3. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS utility classes
4. **Data Layer**: Static fake data (easily replaceable with API)
5. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a Facebook Marketplace clone that can be easily extended with real data sources and additional functionality.
